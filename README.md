# TellMeWhen 3.3.5

This is the same old TellMeWhen available for _WoTLK_, with the exception of being more organized, clean code, localized, Spell ID sensitive and as a bonus: it even tracks internal cooldowns using _LibInternalCooldowns_ library.

## Install:

1. [Download the package.](https://github.com/bkader/TellMeWhen_3.3.5/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Open the archive, then open folder `TellMeWhen_3.3.5-main`.
3. extract the single folder `TellMeWhen` to `Interface\AddOns`.
4. Enjoy!

## What's different from default one?

1. Code cleaned and optimized.
2. If you use spell IDs, it won't get confused when it comes with spells with the same name.
3. Localized! If you want to help me add more locales, please contact me on Discord.
4. In addition to normal cooldowns, it tracks spells and items internal cooldowns.
5. Better configuration interface.
6. Additional settings for groups and icons: **width**, **height** and **spacing**.

## Equivalencies:
